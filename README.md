![DevDrip Logo](https://img.icons8.com/color/96/000000/faucet.png)

A developer-focused token faucet that provides testnet tokens for blockchain development and experimentation. DevDrip offers a streamlined way for developers to acquire test tokens across multiple blockchain networks.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Access test tokens for Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and more
- **Developer-Focused**: Designed specifically for developers needing testnet resources
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for requesting tokens
- **Transaction History**: Track all your token requests in one place
- **Real-Time Stats**: Monitor network status, gas prices, and distribution metrics
- **Secure**: Non-custodial design that connects directly to your wallet

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Testnet network configured in your wallet

### Using DevDrip

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
   - Click the "Connect Wallet" button
   - Authorize the connection in your wallet

2. **Select Token & Network**
   - Choose from available test tokens
   - Ensure you're on the correct testnet

3. **Request Tokens**
   - Click "Get Test Tokens"
   - Confirm the transaction in your wallet

4. **Use Your Tokens**
   - Tokens will arrive in your wallet within minutes
   - Use them for testing smart contracts and dApps

## 🔧 Supported Networks & Tokens

| Network | Test Tokens Available | Faucet Limit | Time Limit |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|------------|
| Ethereum Goerli | ETH, USDC, DAI, LINK | 0.1 ETH / 100 tokens | 24 hours |
| Polygon Mumbai | MATIC, USDC, DAI | 1 MATIC / 100 tokens | 12 hours |
| BSC Testnet | BNB, BUSD | 0.5 BNB / 100 BUSD | 24 hours |
| Avalanche Fuji | AVAX, USDC | 1 AVAX / 100 USDC | 24 hours |

## 🏗️ Architecture

DevDrip consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Handle token distribution logic and constraints
2. **Frontend Interface**: React-based UI for user interaction
3. **Backend Services**: API for rate limiting and analytics (optional)

### Smart Contracts

Our smart contracts are built with Solidity and use OpenZeppelin libraries for security:

```solidity
// Example contract structure
contract DevDripFaucet {
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastRequest;
    uint256 public constant DRIP_AMOUNT = 100 * 10**18;
    uint256 public constant TIME_LIMIT = 86400; // 24 hours
    
    function requestTokens(address token) external {
        require(block.timestamp >= lastRequest[msg.sender] + TIME_LIMIT, "Wait period not over");
        // Distribution logic
    }
}
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devdrip-faucet.git
cd devdrip-faucet
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Infura API key and other configuration
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Compile contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

2. Deploy to testnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## 📊 Analytics

DevDrip includes built-in analytics to track usage:

- Total tokens distributed
- Unique users
- Most requested tokens
- Network usage statistics

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Transaction Fails**
   - Ensure you have enough native token for gas fees
   - Verify you're on the correct network

2. **Tokens Not Received**
   - Check your wallet address
   - Verify the transaction on a block explorer

3. "Wait Period Not Over" Error
   - You can only request tokens once per time period
